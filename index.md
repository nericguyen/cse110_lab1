# All About Eric Nguyen
If you are reading this in the *disastrous* 2025, I'm probably around 20 years old.  There's a lot to know about me, 
but I'd like to start off by saying that I am using this as an assignment per my CSE110 class and will be using about
as much of Markdown as possible.  If it seems like I'm randomly using styles for no reason, **it's because I am**.  Here's
a few key things about me that I think are crucial in my identity.
- I have 3 cats
- I love fighting games and mahjong
- I am in a professional engineering co-od fraternity

The 3 cats I own are all strays.  They are my precious babies

I play hongkong mahjong with my family, but I play riichi mahjong online!  If you ever wanted to get into it, I highly
recommend [this website](https://mahjongsoul.yo-star.com/).

Lastly, I have been a brother of Theta Tau since January 2025.

## A Deeper Delve into the Coding Side of Eric Nguyen
I started coding for an intro to computer programming class sophomore year of high school.  It has been nearly 4 years
since then as of writing this, but I still feel as though I know ~everything~ nothing.  I wonder where that lands me on the dunning
kruger curve.  Much of my memory writing on the terminal is me repeated going `cd ..` `pwd` `ls`.  It is a sad experience.
I feel as though I have the drive to be a good programmer but I don't feel like a "techbro."  I don't understand how
everyone knows everything.  I don't know what I don't know.  It's a sad feeling.
> Off topic, but is this what the lab means by "quoting text," I'm not sure what you want from me.

Anyway, I suppose this will be the order of priorities for my goals for the spring quarter:
1. Find what makes me happy
2. Figure out I am
3. See if software engineering is part of those goals

As you can see, I want to live my life first, which I understand comes with its privilege.  I am  a very fortunate
person to be studying at UCSD, and I hope I find out whatever I am doing with my life soon.

## Playing With Markdown
Okay, the rest of this is me messing around with Markdown while still giving a bit of information about who I am.

Here's a snippet of my bucket list
- [x] see the chicago bean
- [ ] see the eiffel tower
- [ ] skydive

Well, that's about everything.  I hope you enjoyed this tiny window into my life.  I think the beauty
of life is that you truly will never know everything about anyone, and that the human experience is
too grand to detail in just words.  Life is beautiful.
